Innovative Idea:  
This application will be a social media platform type of forum where people who want to meet new people while doing something that they like or want to get into. The person would simply make a profile and then post what they are planning to do, similar to a twitter post or facebook post, then a person would see this and interact with the post showing interest in the activity. The application would then allow them to communicate with each other and plan their trip together. There seems to be other applications like this or can be very similar to a dating app but this app is more towards people wanting to make new friends that have the same interests or hobbies.
The idea is similar to the website “meetup” but it’s targeted only for umass students.
