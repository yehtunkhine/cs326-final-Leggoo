## Innovative Idea:  
This application will be a social media platform type of forum where people who want to meet new people while doing something that they like or want to get into. The person would simply make a profile and then post what they are planning to do, similar to a twitter post or facebook post, then a person would see this and interact with the post showing interest in the activity. The application would then allow them to communicate with each other and plan their trip together. There seems to be other applications like this or can be very similar to a dating app but this app is more towards people wanting to make new friends that have the same interests or hobbies.
The idea is similar to the website “meetup” but it’s targeted only for umass students.

 	The website will first ask the user to sign in or create an account if not have one. During the creating account session, the website will ask the user’s umass email to validate the umass students. And then there will be categories for example “sports, outdoor activities, eating out,...”. The users can post an event or join an event created by other people. The user will have to select the categories and date they want to join and related events will show up. Users can react, comment, share or direct messages to the event creator if they want to join the event. The events the user reacts to will be saved and shown on the user’s profile and other people who go to that user’s profile can see.
