Milestone 2

Steps required to build your project.

- Need to start the npm process with command "npm init" and create dependencies.
- Need to install express.js with command "npm i express"
- Run server.js with node with command "node server.js"
- Then the server will run on localhost 3000 so far before the deployment. 
- In the localhost 3000, different paths will get to different pages of our website.

Milestone 3

- In the server folder, we included the postgres SQL database, “kaja-db.js” that handles database operations like create,get,update,delete,getAll users and create,get,update,delete,getAll events. 
-In sever.js file under server folder, we connect the database file and server file to do the server side CRUD operations.
